The Southern Africa Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostics (SARPAM) is funded by UKAid, through the UK \"Department for International Development (DFID)\":http://www.dfid.gov.uk, to promote a more efficient and competitive market for essential medicines in the \"SADC\":http://www.sadc.int region.\r\n\r\nThis adds to the initiatives of country governments, the \"SADC Secretariat\":http://www.sadc.int/english/sadc-institutions/sadc-secretariat/, Civil Society, the private sector and other development partners to increase access to high quality, affordable, essential medicines to meet the health needs of poor people in the SADC region. SARPAM is being implemented from July 2011 to December 2014.\r\n\r\nh2. The rationale for pharmaceutical market intervention in the SADC\r\n\r\np(justify).. During an inception phase from 2010 to the middle of 2011, surveys were undertaken to establish a baseline understanding of the pharmaceutical marketplace in SADC Member States. This found evidence of market failures that result in uncompetitive drug pricing and unstable availability of medicines, which directly compromises the health and wellbeing of people living in the region, where there is a high burden of treatable disease. For instance, there are significant price disparities between neighbouring countries for the same medicines, and a number of essential medicine products are not obtainable from accredited suppliers.\r\n\r\nThe implementation phase of SARPAM was therefore designed in consultation with Member States, the SADC Secretariat and other stakeholders to respond to these identified needs and priorities \u2013 in particular, to progress key elements of the \"SADC Pharmaceutical Business Plan (PBP)\":http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media/Services/PSD/BEP/SADC%20PHARMACEUTICAL%20BUSINESS%20PLAN%20-APPROVED%20PLAN.pdf.\r\n\r\nRegional geographical and market integration requires medicines regulation, control, procurement and distribution to be harmonised across Member States because medicines trade between countries is highly regulated. Differing regulatory requirements and controls are part of the reason that significant differences are found in the quality, availability and competitiveness of medicines between countries in the SADC, which does not yet function as a regional pharmaceutical marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe regional health threats of HIV, TB and malaria epidemics can also be more effectively addressed through countries working together (as described in the \"SADC Protocol on Health\":http://www.sadc.int/english/key-documents/protocols/protocol-on-health/) and countries need to manage the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases.\r\n\r\nEvidence from other regional initiatives suggests that there are substantial gains to be made through regional co-operation on these highly technical pharmaceutical and health issues. Harmonised regulation will establish incentives for pharmaceutical suppliers to enter the market of smaller countries, and lead to a more competitive environment with fewer inter-country variances.\r\n\r\n<br/>\"Read more...\":http://www.sarpam.net.",

Tendai means 'thank you' in Shona, an African language native to Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\n!(right)/static/website/img/tendai.png(Tendia uses mobile phones as a data collection device.)!\r\n\r\np(justify).. Through Tendai, community health workers from a network of Civil Society partners use mobile phones to collect data on the availability of medicines at points of access in participating countries (South Africa, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, DRC and Tanzania). SARPAM co-ordinates the data using customised open-source survey software.\r\n\r\nIndividuals from local communities are trained and sent out to collect first-hand information on medicines availability and pricing. A selection of public sector health facilities and medicines dispensaries are identified in each district to provide a good level of geographic coverage. Each community monitor collects relevant information in their area and submits reports, including GPS co-ordinates, using an inexpensive Android mobile phone. Customised software allows\r\nthe monitors to capture many types of instantly accessible data, including digital surveys, voice recordings and photos that provide insight into the real issues at community level. This data helps highlight the plight of people living with disease and accurately monitors issues around the availability of quality medicines.\r\n\r\nThis data can be shared immediately via the mobile web and sent to the dedicated Tendai project section on the Medicines InfoHub, as well as social networks and mailing lists. The data helps identify problems and monitors interventions and advocacy.\r\n\r\nIn addition Tendai links Civil Society networks with each other and assists in the collection of market intelligence.\r\n\r\n<br/>\"Read more...

At a broader level, SEATINI seeks to:\r\n\r\n* to network with academics, policy makers, NGOs and civil society movements concerned about the forces and effects of globalization on Africa and the Third World generally;\r\n* to help democratise international economic decision-making organisations, such as the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO;\r\n* to contribute to the fight for social justice, democracy and good governance, without partisan, sectarian or sexism.\r\n\r\n<br/>\"Read more...\":http://www.seatini.org/index.html\r\n\r\nh2(#tac). Treatment Action Campaign\r\n\r\n!(right)/static/website/img/tac.png(Treatment Action Campaign)!\r\n\r\np(justify).. Founded on 10 December 1998 in Cape Town, South Africa, The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) advocates for increased access to treatment, care and support services for people living with HIV and campaigns to reduce new HIV infections.\r\n\r\nWith more than 16,000 members, 267 branches and 72 full time staff members, TAC has become the leading civil society force behind comprehensive health care services for people living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Since 1998, TAC has held government accountable for health care service delivery; campaigned against official AIDS denialism; challenged the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies to make treatment more affordable and cultivated community leadership on HIV and AIDS.\r\n\r\nTAC\u2019s efforts have resulted in many life-saving interventions, including the implementation of country-wide mother-to-child transmission prevention and antiretroviral treatment programmes. For their efforts TAC has received world-wide acclaim and numerous international accolades, including a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. On 30 August 2006 the New York Times named TAC, \u201cthe world\u2019s most effective AIDS group\u201d.\r\n\r\n<br/>\"Read more...\":http://www.tac.org.za/community/",

The \"Southern African Development Community (SADC)\":http://www.sadc.int/ started as the Frontline States, the objective of which was political liberation in Southern Africa. The SADC was preceded by the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), which was formed in Lusaka, Zambia on April 1 1980 with the adoption of the Lusaka Declaration (Southern Africa: Towards Economic Liberation).\r\n\r\nThe formation of the SADCC was the culmination of a long process of consultations by the leaders of the then-only-majority-ruled countries of Southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia) working together as the Frontline States.\r\n\r\nThe SADC has 15 Member States, namely: Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nPopulation: 257, 726,000\r\nGross Domestic Product: 471,118 US$ billion\r\n\r\nThe SADC\u2019s vision is that of a common future, a future within a regional community that will ensure economic wellbeing, improvement of standards of living and quality of life, freedom, social justice and peace and security for the people of Southern Africa. This shared vision is anchored on the common values and principles and the historical and cultural affinities that exist between the people of Southern Africa.\r\n\r\nThe SADC mission is to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth and socio-economic development through efficient productive systems, deeper co-operation and integration, good governance and durable peace and security, so that the region emerges as a competitive and effective player in international relations and the world economy.\r\n\r\n<br/>\"Read more...\":http://www.sadc.int/",

When the \"Department for International Development (DFID)\":http://www.dfid.gov.uk/ was set up in 1997, it made fighting world poverty its top priority. This marked a turning point for Britain\u2019s aid programme, which until then had mainly involved economic development.\r\n\r\nIn its manifesto the government elected in May 1997 pledged to create a new department for international development headed by a cabinet minister. Previously the aid programme was managed by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), a wing of the \"Foreign and Commonwealth Office\":http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/.\r\n\r\nAmong its key objectives, \"DFID\":http://www.dfid.gov.uk/ set out to make global development a national priority and promote it to audiences in the UK and overseas, while fostering a new \u2018aid relationship\u2019 with governments of developing countries.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1997, DFID published its first white paper with the focus on eliminating world poverty. Three other white papers, issued in 2000, 2006 and 2009 reinforced the first white paper\u2019s message.\r\n\r\nTwo acts of parliament have since helped to put development higher on the national agenda. The International Development Act 2002 clarified the purpose of aid spending as poverty reduction; while International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Act 2006 defined DFID\u2019s annual reporting to Parliament through its Annual Report.\r\n\r\n<br/>\"Read more...\":http://www.dfid.gov.uk/",
